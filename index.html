                            <small>
                                With the 12th generation of Intel, the processor wars between AMD and Intel have heated up significantly, so,
                                ideally <b>within the last 2 years</b>.  There are some ü¶Ñs from previous generations if you are really strapped
                                for cash, however, you will need to do your research for these.

                            <small>
                                For a good rough cut, this is a decent option.  It allows you to select CPUs across generations and compare their
                                effective speed against one another.  Keep in mind that their data is user provided so can be skewed by thermal
                                issues, windows updates, or other things people don't consider before benchmarking.

                                Generally you should look for features that bring <b>generational</b> improvements to
                                connectivity (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express">PCIe</a>

                                in this regard, but other name-brand manufacturers like Asrock, Gigabyte, MSI,
                                and others should work well as well.

                        <p>
                            <small>
                                Good power delivery comes down to the quality of components (e.g.
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_regulator_module">VRMs</a>)
                                used to deliver power to the CPU.  Generally you should look at the total
                                power that the motherboard can deliver to the CPU compared to the maximum
                                draw of CPUs that are compatible with that
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket">socket</a>.
                                You should again stick to name-brands and not buy the absolute cheapest
                                motherboard out there.

                                them in benchmarks for games that you intend to play.  As with CPUs,

                                Modular (or semi-modular) power supplies are great in more compact builds where you don't want
                                to manage extra cables.  Personally I like them and feel they are worth the extra cost but
                                YMMV.

                                80 Plus is a certification rating the efficiency of a power supply.  You should look for a supply
                                that is at least 80 Plus White since non-80 Plus supplies can have irregular power bands that
                                increase apparent power at the wall.  You can learn more about 80 Plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus">here.</a>

                                Usually you need to look at the spec sheets for various components to determine widths/heights and clearances.
                                Generally a larger case can fit more, and a smaller case can fit less.  Building compact cases is harder in this regard.

                        <p>
                            A "fast" core is made from a combination of clocking quickly (measured in GHz)
                            and executing instructions in as few clock cycles as possible (measured in
                            Instructions per Cycle).

                            <small>
                                With the 12th generation of Intel, the processor wars between AMD and Intel have heated up significantly, so,
                                ideally <b>within the last 2 years</b>.  There are some unicorns from previous generations if you are really strapped
                                for cash, however, you will need to do your research on these.

                        <h3>How do I compare CPUs easily?</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i3-12100F-vs-Group-/4125vs10">User Benchmark</a></p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                For a good rough cut, this is a decent option.  It allows you to select CPUs across generations and compare their
                                effective speed against one another.  Do keep in mind that their data is user provided so can be skewed by thermal
                                issues, windows updates, or other things users don't consider before benchmarking.

                                Generally you should look for features that bring <b>generational</b> improvements to
                                connectivity (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express">PCIe</a>
                                or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a>).  Sparkly features (like built
                                in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>) should only be
                                purchased if really desired.

                            <small>
                                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">BIOS</a>/
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI">UEFI</a> is the
                                boot environment your computer first goes into before the
                                operating system.  Having this be well supported by your
                                manufacturer adds stability and configuration options.  I have
                                had good luck with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwFTJ90jH6c">Asus</a>
                                in this regard, but other name-brand manufacturers like Asrock, Gigabyte, MSI,
                                and others should work well as well.

                        <h3>What is "good" power delivery?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                Good power delivery comes down to the quality of components (e.g.
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_regulator_module">VRMs</a>)
                                used to deliver power to the CPU.  Generally you should look at the total
                                power that the motherboard can deliver to the CPU compared to the maximum
                                draw of CPUs that are compatible with that socket.  You should again stick
                                to name-brands and not buy the absolute cheapest motherboard from them.

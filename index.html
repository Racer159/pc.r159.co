                        <p>
                            A "fast" core is made from a combination of clocking quickly (measured in GHz)
                            and executing instructions in as few clock cycles as possible (measured in
                            Instructions per Cycle).

                                With the 12th generation of Intel, the processor wars between AMD and Intel have heated up significantly, so,
                                ideally <b>within the last 2 years</b>.  There are some unicorns from previous generations if you are really strapped
                                for cash, however, you will need to do your research on these.

                        <h3>How do I compare CPUs easily?</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i3-12100F-vs-Group-/4125vs10">User Benchmark</a></p>

                                For a good rough cut, this is a decent option.  It allows you to select CPUs across generations and compare their
                                effective speed against one another.  Do keep in mind that their data is user provided so can be skewed by thermal
                                issues, windows updates, or other things users don't consider before benchmarking.

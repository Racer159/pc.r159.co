# PC Building Thoughts

This repository contains some of my thoughts around choosing parts to build a personal computer.  These are mostly my opinions and there are many other reputable voices in the PC building space.  I mostly built this as a simple way to share my own perspective on the hobby with others.

## Building this site

This site uses reveal.js with typescript and webpack to build it into a static site hosted on Github pages.  To build a new version of this site simply run:

```
npm run build
```
